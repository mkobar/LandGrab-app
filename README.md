### The Idea
The idea is to allow people to capture locations in the Real World.  This app was Alvis's idea.

### How It Works
The user captures blocks of land by moving to them and the one with the most land wins at the end of the contest.  This is a perfect way to introduce a new person to a new location.


### How It Was Built
This mobile application was built with the sweet [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) (Angular.js/JavaScript/CSS/HTML5) and uses the [Proximi.io](https://www.Proximi.io/) service for location and map data. 

### What's next for LandGrab
Additional features could be added like
